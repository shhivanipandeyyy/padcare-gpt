PadCare Labs is a sustainability-focused startup working on menstrual waste management.

Problem:
India generates a large amount of sanitary waste every day. Most used sanitary pads end up in landfills or water bodies, which harms the environment and poses health risks to people handling waste.

Solution:
PadCare provides a closed-loop system for managing used sanitary pads. The pads are collected from schools, offices, and institutions using safe disposal bins. The waste is then treated using a hygienic and environmentally responsible process instead of being dumped.

Process:
PadCare’s system ensures that used sanitary pads are safely handled, treated, and converted into recycled material. This reduces landfill waste, prevents pollution, and improves working conditions for handlers.

Impact:
By offering a sustainable alternative, PadCare helps reduce environmental damage while improving menstrual hygiene awareness. Their work also supports safer working conditions for people handling sanitary waste.

Who they work with:
PadCare collaborates with schools, offices, factories, and institutions to promote responsible menstrual waste disposal and better hygiene practices.
